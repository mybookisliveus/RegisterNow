          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to BookHaven Digital ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to it. This policy applies to all information collected through our website.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            As a privacy-focused platform, we collect the absolute minimum information necessary to provide and improve our service. We do not require user accounts to access our library. The information we collect falls into two categories:
          </p>
          <h3>A. Usage Data</h3>
          <p>We may automatically collect anonymous information when you visit our website. This Usage Data may include information such as your device's IP address (anonymized), browser type, browser version, the pages of our service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, and other diagnostic data. This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>
          <h3>B. Tracking & Cookies Data</h3>
          <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track activity on our service and hold certain information. Cookies are files with a small amount of data. We use a simple cookie to manage your consent for our cookie policy. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.</p>

          <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            BookHaven Digital uses the collected anonymous data for the following purposes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>To provide, maintain, and improve our website's functionality.</li>
            <li>To monitor the usage of our service to identify popular content and areas for improvement.</li>
            <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues.</li>
            <li>To ensure the security and integrity of our platform.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>We will never sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.</strong></p>

          <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
          <p>
            The security of your data is important to us. We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your information. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
          <p>
            Because we do not collect personally identifiable information, most data protection rights are not applicable. However, you have the right to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Manage Cookies:</strong> You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website, though your access to some functionality may be restricted.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact Us:</strong> You have the right to contact us with any questions or concerns about our privacy practices.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Our service does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Links to Other Websites</h2>

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
